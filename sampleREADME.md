  ## Description
  This application uses NodeJS and the command-line to generate a professional README.md file. It will take the users input using Inquirer package to prompt the questions and collect the data. This application will help the user save time while still allowing a professional README file to be created. This project allowed me to practice using NodeJS. I learned how to use and install dependencies. I also learned how to use packages like inquirer. The most interesting and difficult concept I learned from this project was NodeJS' file structure and how they work together as well as how to link them.
